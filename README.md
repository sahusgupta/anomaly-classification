# anomaly-classification
 Machine learning model created using Python to classify recieved network traffic.
This model was created for my AP Research paper
DISCLAIMER/WARNING: Due to large data sample sizes, the model's dataset could not be included, and any tests of the model's effectiveness should be done with small samples from the population of at least 150 and 700 pieces for training and testing data.
